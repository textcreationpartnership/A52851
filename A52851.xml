            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>On the morrow, being well refre≈øht with ≈øleep, the wind cea≈øed, and the weather was very warm; we went down the Rocks on the Sands at low Water, where we found great part of our lading, either on ≈øhore or floating near it. I by the help of my company, dragged mo≈øt of it on ≈øhore; what was too heavy for us we broke, and unbound the Casks and Che≈øts, and, taking out the goods, ≈øecured all; ≈øo that we wanted no clothes, nor any other provi≈øion nece≈ø≈øary for Hou≈øekeeping, to furni≈øh a better Hou≈øe than any we were like to have; but no Victuals (the ≈øalt Water having ≈øpoiled all) onely one Cask of Bisket, being lighter than the re≈øt was dry; this ≈øerved for Bread a while, and we found no Land a ≈øort of fowl about the bigne≈ø≈øe of a Swan, very heavy and fat, that by rea≈øon of their weight could not fly, of the≈øe we found little difficulty to kill, ≈øo that they were our pre≈øent food; we carried out of <hi>England</hi> certain Hens and Cocks to eat by the way, ≈øome of the≈øe when the Ship was broken, by ≈øome means got to Land, and bred exceedingly, ≈øo that in the future they were a great help unto us; we found al≈øo, by a little River, in the flags, ≈øtore of eggs, of a ≈øort of fowl much like our Ducks, which were very good meat, ≈øo that we want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing to keep us alive.</p>
            <p>On the morrow, which was the third day, as ≈øoon as it was morning, ≈øeeing nothing to di≈øturb us, I lookt out a convenient place to dwell in, that we might build us a Hut to ≈øhelter us from the weather, and from any other danger of annoyance, from wild Bea≈øts (if any ≈øhould find us out): So clo≈ø≈øe by a large Spring which ro≈øe out of a high hill over looking the Sea; on the ≈øide of a Wood, having a pro≈øpect towards the Sea (by the help of an Ax and ≈øome other implements, for we had all nece≈ø≈øaries, the working of the Sea, having ca≈øt up mo≈øt of our goods) I cut down all the ≈øtreighte≈øt poles I could find, and which were enough for my purpo≈øe, by the help of my company, (nece≈ø≈øity

            <p>The Woods afforded us a ≈øort of Nuts, as big as a large Apple, who≈øe kernil being plea≈øant and dry, we made u≈øe of in≈øtead of Bread, that Fowl before mentioned, and a ≈øort of Water-fowl like Ducks, and their Eggs, and a Bea≈øt about the ≈øize of a Goat, and almo≈øt ≈øuch a like Creature, which brought two young ones at a time, and that twice a year, of which the Low Lands and Woods were very full, being a very harmle≈øs Creature and tame, ≈øo that we could ea≈øily take and kill them: Fi≈øh al≈øo, e≈øpecially Shell-fi≈øh (which we could be≈øt come by) we had great ≈øtore of, ≈øo that in effect as to Food we wanted nothing; and thus, and by ≈øuch like helps, we continued ≈øix moneths, without any di≈øturbance or want.</p>

I had per≈øwaded the two Maids to let me lie with them, which I did at fir≈øt in private, but after, cu≈øtome tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away ≈øhame (there being none but us) we did it more openly, as our Lu≈øt gave us liberty; afterwards my Ma≈øters Daughter was content al≈øo to do as we did; the truth is, they were all hand≈øome women, when they had clothes, and well ≈øhaped, feeding well. For we wanted no Food, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving idlely, and ≈øeeing us at liberty to do our wills, without hope of ever returning home made us thus bold: One of the fir≈øt of my Con≈øorts, with whom I fir≈øt accompanied (the talle≈øt and hand≈øome≈øt) proved pre≈øently with child, the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was my Ma≈øters Daughter, and the other al≈øo not long after fell into the ≈øame condition: none now remaining but my <hi>Megro,</hi> who ≈øeeing what we did, longed al≈øo for her ≈øhare one night, I being a≈øleep, my <hi>Negro</hi> (with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of others) got clo≈øe to me, thinking it being dark to begule me, but I awaking and feeling her, and perceiving who it was, yet willing to try the difference, ≈øatisfied my ≈øelf with her, as well as with one of the re≈øt; that night al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the fir≈øt time, ≈øhe proved al≈øo with child, ≈øo that in the year of our being here, all my women were with child by me, and they all coming at different ≈øea≈øons, were a great help to one another.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt brought me a brave boy, my Ma≈øters Daughter was the younge≈øt ≈øhe brought me a Girl, ≈øo did the other Maid, who being ≈øomething fat ≈øped wor≈øe at her labour, <hi>the</hi> Negro <hi>had no pain at all, and brought me a fine white Girle, ≈øo I had one Boy, and three Girles:</hi> the Women were ≈øoon well again, <hi>and the two fir≈øt with child again, before the two la≈øt were brought to bed:</hi> My cu≈øtome being not to lie with any of them after they were with child, till other were ≈øo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe; <hi>and not with the Black, at all after: ≈øhe was with child:</hi> which commonly was at the fir≈øt tiem, I lay with her, which <hi>was in the night and not el≈øe,</hi> my ≈øtomach would not ≈øerve me, although ≈øhe was one of the hand≈øome≈øt Blacks, I had ≈øeen, and her children as comely as any fo the re≈øt; <hi>we had no clothes for them, and therefore when they had ≈øuckt, we ≈øaid, them in M<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95125:5"/>never failing once a year at lea≈øt, and none of the Children (for all the hard≈øhip we put them to) were ever ≈øick; ≈øo that wanting now nothing but Cloathes, nor them much neither, other then for decency, the warmth of the Countrey and Cu≈øtome ≈øupplying that Defect, we were now well ≈øatisfied with our condition, our Family beginning to grow large, and there being nothing to hurt us, we many times lay abroad on Mo≈ø≈øey Banks, under the ≈øhelter of ≈øome Trees, or ≈øuch like (for having nothing el≈øe to do) I had made me ≈øeveral Arbors to ≈øleep in with my Women in the heat of the day, in the≈øe I and my Women pa≈ø≈øed the time away, they being never willing to be out of my company.</p>
            <p>And having now no thought of ever returning home, as having re≈øolved and ≈øworn each to other, never to part or leave one another, or the place; having by my ≈øeveral Wives, forty ≈øeven Children, Boys and Girls, but mo≈øt Girls, and growing up apace, we were all of us very fle≈øhy, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ≈øo well agreeing with us, that we never ailed any thing; my <hi>Negro</hi> having had twelve, was the fir≈øt that left bearing, ≈øo I never medled with her more: My Ma≈øters Daughter (by whom I had mo≈øt Children, being the younge≈øt and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øome≈øt) was mo≈øt fond of me, and I of her. Thus we lived for ≈øixteen years, till perceiving my elde≈øt Boy to mind the ordinary work of Nature, by ≈øeeing what we did, I gave him a Mate, and ≈øo I did to all the re≈øt, as fa≈øt as they grew up, and were capable: My Wives having left bearing, my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren began to breed apace, ≈øo we were like to be a multitude; My fir≈øt Wife brought me thirteen Children, my ≈øecond ≈øeven, my Ma≈øters Daughter fifteen, and the <hi>Negro</hi> twelve, in all forty ≈øeven.</p>
            <p>After we had lived there twenty two years, my <hi>Negro</hi> died ≈øuddenly, but I could not percive any thing that ailed her; mo≈øt of my children being grown, as fa≈øt as we married them, I ≈øent them and placed them over the River by them≈øelves ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, becau≈øe we would not pe≈øter one another; and now they being all grown up, and gone, and married after our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner (≈øome two or three of the younge≈øt) for (growing my ≈øelf into years) I liked not the wanton annoyance of young company.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:95125:6"/>
            <p>Thus having lived to the ≈øixtieth year of my age, and the fortieth of my coming thither, at which time I ≈øent for all of them to bring their children, and there were in number de≈øcended from me by the≈øe four Women, of my Children, Grand-children, &amp; great Grand-children, five hundred ≈øixty five of both ≈øorts; I took off the Males of one Family, and marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to the Females of another, not letting any to marry their ≈øi≈øters, as we did formerly out of nece≈ø≈øity, ≈øo ble≈ø≈øing God for his Providence and goodne≈øs, I di≈ømi≈øt them, I having taught ≈øome of my Children to read formerly, for I had left ≈øtill the Bible, I charged it ≈øhould be read once a moneth at a general meeting: At la≈øt one of my Wives died being ≈øixty eighth years of age, which I buried in a place, ≈øet out on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, and within a year after another, ≈øo I had none now left but my Ma≈øters Daughter, and we lived together twelve years longer, at length ≈øhe died al≈øo, ≈øo I buried her al≈øo next the place where I purpo≈øed to be buried my ≈øelf, and the tall Maid my fir≈øt Wife next me on the other ≈øide, the <hi>Negro</hi> next without her, and the other Maid next my Ma≈øters Daughter. I had now nothing to mind, but the place whether I was to go, being very old, almo≈øt eighty years, I gave my Cabin and Furniture that was left to my elde≈øt ≈øon after my decea≈øe, who had married my elde≈øt Daughter by my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Wife, whom I made King and Governour of all the re≈øt: I informed them of the Manners of <hi>Europe,</hi> and charged them to remember the Chri≈øtian Religion, after the manner of them that ≈øpake the ≈øame Language, and to admit no other, if hereafter any ≈øhould come and find them out.</p>
            <p>And now once for all, I ≈øummoned them to come to me, that I might number them, which I did, and found the e≈øtimate to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in or about the eightieth year of my age, and the fifty ninth of my coming there; in all of all ≈øorts one thou≈øand ≈øeven hundred eighty and nine. Thus praying God to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them, and ≈øend them the true light of the Go≈øpel, I la≈øt of all di≈ømi≈øt them: For, being now very old, and my ≈øight decayed, I could not expect to live long.
